This is an exploration into computer-generated sounds, particularly pertaining to music and synthesizing instrumental sounds.
I'm exploring what goes into making a sound; why a bowed string might sound one way and a resonant pipe another. I'm also exploring some basic signal processing concepts such as the Fourier transform, and applying filters to sounds. This is foundational knowledge that really interests me in its further applications, such as more advanced computer music techniques, or on the other hand, speech processing.
